# Go f-strings for VS Code

A VS Code extension that brings Python-like f-string syntax to Go through special comments.

![Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0113533-dfff-4b60-8c74-f0ee4e298ce1)

## Features

This extension allows you to write string formatting in Go using a more concise, Python-inspired f-string syntax. It automatically converts special comments into equivalent `fmt.Sprintf` statements.

Simply write a comment with the syntax:

```go
// fstring result := "Hello, {name}!"
```
* You can also use `//fs` `//fstring` or `// fs`

And it will automatically be converted to:

```go
result := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)
```
* Using `=` in the comment will also use `=` in the output instead of `:=`

The extension also ensures that the `fmt` package is imported when needed.

## How It Works

- Add a comment starting with `// fstring` `//fs` `//fstring` or `// fs` followed by a variable assignment and string with placeholders in curly braces
- The extension automatically converts this to a proper Go `fmt.Sprintf` statement on the next line
- The conversion happens when you open Go files or make changes to them

## Requirements

- VS Code version 1.98.0 or higher
- Working with Go files
